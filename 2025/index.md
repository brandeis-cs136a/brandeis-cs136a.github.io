# Course Introduction and Learning Goals

This course charts the evolution of automatic speech recognition by exploring the central question: *what does it mean to statistically model speech*? We begin with the foundational HMM-GMM tradition, which treated speech as a sequence of acoustic events modeled by probabilistic state machines. These acoustic models were historically guided by separate n-gram language models that imposed statistical constraints on word order. We then pivot to the modern deep learning era, examining how neural network architectures—which leverage components like attention, convolutions, and recurrent layers—revolutionized feature representation and sequential modeling to learn a single, unified statistical representation directly from audio.

As a result of taking this course and fully engaging with the material and required work, you will be able to:

* Explain the fundamental principles of statistics, probability, information theory, and computation that underpin various computational and data-driven disciplines.
* Understand and analyze trending machine learning practices for speech, including audio feature extraction, complex neural architectures around convolution and attention, and fine-tuning of neural nets.
* Develop proficiency in a Linux/Unix environment, including the command line interface, file systems, common utilities, and scripting.
* Employ version control systems (specifically `git`) and write reproducible, well-documented code to support maintainable projects.
